But it requires a thorough, vetted source of information and contacts in departments like business development, sales and recruiting.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why a growing number of businesses rely on <a href=\"http:\/\/crunchbase.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crunchbase<\/a>, asserts CEO Jager McConnell. With roots in a homegrown project by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington designed to index startups featured in TechCrunch articles, Crunchbase has evolved over the past 15 years into an API-driven database of startups and financial reports, along with a growing news division.<\/p>\n<p>Crunchbase now attracts over 75 million unique visitors annually and recently surpassed 60,000 paying customers, with over half of the Fortune 500 represented, according to McConnell.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We find and engage with qualified accounts, while simultaneously creating awareness for companies that want to be discovered,&#8221; he told TechCrunch via email. &#8220;From the day of our spinout [as an independent company in 2015] \u2026 we\u2019ve built a prospecting platform powered by the best-in-class proprietary data we\u2019re known for, allowing deal-makers to find and engage with qualified accounts while simultaneously creating awareness for companies that want to be discovered.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Investors seem convinced. This morning, Crunchbase closed an oversubscribed $50 million series D round led by Alignment Growth with participation from OMERS Ventures, Mayfield and Emergence Capital. CEO Jager McConnell declined to reveal the valuation but described it as a &#8220;significant up round.&#8221; Crunchbase had a <a href=\"https:\/\/my.pitchbook.com\/profile\/85884-22\/company\/profile#comparisons\">post-money valuation of $70 million<\/a>, according to PitchBook &#8212; a Crunchbase competitor, ironically.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2354876\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2354876\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2354876\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png\" alt=\"CrunchBase\" width=\"1024\" height=\"657\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png 3300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png?resize=150,96 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png?resize=300,192 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png?resize=768,492 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png?resize=680,436 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png?resize=1536,985 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png?resize=2048,1313 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Crunchbase-Profile.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2354876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Crunchbase<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Crunchbase software-as-a service platform combines rich and proprietary company data with direct access to decision-makers within a single intuitive interface &#8212; at compelling price points, making it a powerful tool for driving return on investment across a variety of use cases, from sales to recruiting and more,&#8221; Alignment growth partner Alex Iosilevich said in an emailed statement. Iosilevich plans to soon join the Crunchbase board of directors. &#8220;We expect that Crunchbase will continue to gain accelerated industry adoption and are excited to support the company\u2019s growth momentum alongside strong participation from the existing investor group.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The core of Crunchbase as it exists today is a research suite for sales teams. Entries show when a company was founded, its founders and executive leadership, and financing and debt rounds (and their contributors). Paid Crunchbase plans unlock data about competitors, history and more.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Crunchbase employs a team of writers covering funding rounds and other Crunchbase-relevant content over at Crunchbase News. (This writer has been known to cite their work from time to time.) As for the primary database, it&#8217;s updated manually and automatically by way of thousands of partnerships and syndication deals with LinkedIn, Business Insider and others.<\/p>\n<p>The way McConnell sees it, Crunchbase can reduce the amount of time sales teams spend prospecting by highlighting companies with\u00a0 &#8220;growth signals&#8221; &#8212; for example, funding rounds or increased product adoption.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As difficult economic conditions impact more companies, knowing whether a target account is on the upswing or not gives prospectors the power to focus outreach on decision-makers with buying power,&#8221; McConnell said. &#8220;Our tools encourage account-based selling, which encourages deal-makers to prioritize their prospecting efforts based on the companies they should be contacting rather than the individuals. This is the opposite approach to &#8216;spray and pray,&#8217; which relies on massive contact lists and leads to the kind of spammy outreach that no one likes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Additions to the platform within the past few months focus on discovery, for example allowing Crunchbase customers to find companies that meet a profile by filtering for territories or characteristics like &#8220;diversity.&#8221; Machine learning-powered recommendations show new accounts and similar companies to consider, while customer relationship management data in search spotlights accounts that might be new to a given salesperson.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond discovery, McConnell drew attention to Crunchbase&#8217;s recent qualification and tracking improvements, like a Chrome extension that shows context on accounts as they&#8217;re being researched. Crunchbase customers can now sync new accounts that meet their criteria to Salesforce and get email alerts on &#8220;priority&#8221; accounts, or created lists, saved searches, notes and tags for matches.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2354874\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2354874\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2354874\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png\" alt=\"CrunchBase\" width=\"1024\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png?resize=300,151 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png?resize=768,388 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png?resize=680,343 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png?resize=1536,775 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png?resize=2048,1034 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.23.57-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2354874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Crunchbase<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On the engagement tooling side, Crunchbase now shows &#8220;decision-maker&#8221; contact data &#8212; which is searchable &#8212; and integrates with email providers including Gmail. Customers can use auto-generated email templates that pull in relevant, targeted data about prospects of particular interest.<\/p>\n<p>McConnell says that Crunchbase resisted adding contact data for &#8220;a long time&#8221; due to privacy concerns but ultimately came to the conclusion that it was &#8220;incredibly valuable&#8221; for customers. &#8220;We\u2019ve gone out of our way to make sure we\u2019re doing this the right way, encouraging informed outreach and complying with all laws and regulations as they currently stand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Thankfully, our business model does not at all depend on contact data.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Crunchbase competes not only with the aforementioned PitchBook but with CB Insights, Owler and other prospecting services and databases. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/10\/lusha-a-crowdsourced-data-platform-for-b2b-sales-gets-205m-series-b-at-1-5b-valuation\/\">Lusha<\/a>, a crowdsourced data platform for business-to-business sales, recently raised $205 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Apollo.io <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/03\/apollo-io-raises-110m-as-its-crosses-16k-paying-users-of-its-sales-intelligence-platform\/\">landed<\/a> $110 million as its sales intelligence platform crossed 16,000 paying companies.<\/p>\n<p>McConnell sees differentiation &#8212; and raw ambition &#8212; as the key to Crunchbase&#8217;s continued growth. To this end, Crunchbase plans to launch an integration with Hubspot and enhanced machine learning-powered suggestions that recommend accounts, contacts and tasks toward various prospecting goals. Also in development are more sophisticated dashboards to help customers track &#8220;efficacy of activities&#8221; on Crunchbase, including annual recurring revenue (ARR) generated by opportunities discovered through the platform.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The recent onslaught of down rounds and mass layoffs from companies who very recently hit unicorn status shows how outsized burn rates can be hidden behind oversized funding rounds, covering up the reality of weak business fundamentals,&#8221; McConnell said. &#8220;I&#8217;m especially proud of the fact that we have been able to generate growth while keeping our burn rate in check. In the first half of this year, we drove $9 million net new ARR at only $2 million burn &#8212; that&#8217;s best in class according to Bessemer&#8217;s efficiency benchmarks,and puts us on the path to profitability \u2026 We plan to double our business-to-business software ARR this year, ending around $38 million in ARR just for this customer segment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Crunchbase&#8217;s latest funding brings its total raised to $106.5 million. A portion of the proceeds will be put toward expanding the 220-person team to around 275 by the end of the year, according to McConnell.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In both down times and boom times, businesses across industries are faced with the challenge of building sales pipelines and closing revenue. &#8220;Account-based&#8221; intelligence &#8212; i.e., research into potential customers &#8212; can help during the prospecting process.

And this is what its fresh $20 million cash injection will be used for, as it looks to broaden its horizons beyond its native Germany.<\/p>\n<p>One point worth noting is that Charles has specifically built its platform with Europe&#8217;s data privacy laws (i.e. GDPR) firmly in mind. With WhatsApp newsletters, for example, Charles presents double opt-ins for customers after they indicate that they want to receive WhatsApp messages &#8212; so the customer may ask to sign up for the newsletter (first opt-in), and then they are asked a second time to confirm that this is what they want. And all of this is automated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Targeting Europe, one of our main differentiators is the fact that we have built-in GDPR compliance from the get-go,&#8221; Charles cofounder and co-CEO Artjem Weissbeck told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2356311\" style=\"width: 629px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2356311\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2356311\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GDPR.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GDPR.png 619w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GDPR.png?resize=150,97 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GDPR.png?resize=300,194 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GDPR.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2356311\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Charles says it&#8217;s GDPR compliant<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Not everyone will be happy to have targeted marketing and advertising landing in their WhatsApp inbox every day, and that is why Charles is focusing on the opt-in \/ opt-out workflows. It&#8217;s not the same as email, and it needs to be treated accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To be GDPR-compliant, brands need an initial opt-in from you for notifications, while an opt-out is possible at any time,&#8221; Weissbeck continued. &#8220;That&#8217;s also why we help brands with our automated opt-in and opt-out technology, and our success team advise them on frequency and relevance of notifications. Contrary to email, they should be low-frequency and high-relevance to respect the intimacy of the channel and keep the trust provided by the consumer. On average this means one to two campaigns per month.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Although Charles has seen the most traction in its domestic German market, it has already seen some inbound interest from Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and the U.K. And longer term, it sees itself extending to markets elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These are the countries that we\u2019ve started to expand into, and more than 20% of our customers come from there &#8212; particularly Italy and the U.K.,&#8221; cofounder and co-CEO Andreas Tussing added. &#8220;Our ultimate ambition is global, and we selectively pilot with companies outside of Europe.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In its relatively short life so far, Charles said that some of its one hundred-plus customers have already hit 7-digit WhatsApp revenues this year, representing up to 40% of their overall sales. But Charles is cognizant of the fact that while WhatsApp is a preeminent messaging platform in Europe, it&#8217;s not the only player in town &#8212; that&#8217;s why it supports Instagram Direct and Facebook Messenger too, while it&#8217;s also working on support for Telegram, iMessage, RCS, Google MyBusiness Chat, and SMS.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;However, most businesses in Europe focus on WhatsApp as consumer penetration is the highest, rich formats are advanced, and API capabilities for businesses are most advanced,&#8221; Tussing noted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Conversational commerce isn&#8217;t exactly a new phenomenon, with countless companies using live chats, messaging apps, chatbots, voice assistants and more to encourage consumers to part with their cash.

India to date, demonstrating just how large of a presence it has marked in the world\u2019s second largest phone market in just eight years.<\/p>\n<p>The Chinese giant, which began selling smartphones in India in 2014, revealed the figure at a media conference on Wednesday, where it pledged future commitment to the country. It took Xiaomi <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/06\/xiaomi-100-million-smartphones-india\/\">five years to ship its first 100 million smartphones in India<\/a>, and just three for the next. The company claimed it has held the tentpole position in the Indian smartphone market since 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The announcement comes at a time when Indian authorities have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/13\/india-oppo-customs-duty\/\">stepped up a crackdown on Chinese smartphone makers in the country<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Indian authorities have alleged that Chinese phonemakers Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi have engaged in tax evasion practices. The companies have denied any wrongdoing. China\u2019s embassy in India <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/07\/china-india-business-confidence-vivo\/\">criticized Indian authorities earlier this month<\/a> for \u201cfrequent investigations\u201d into local units of Chinese firms and warned that such moves \u201cimpede the improvement of [the] business environment\u201d in India and \u201cchills the confidence and willingness\u201d of other foreign nation\u2019s businesses to invest and operate in the South Asian market.<\/p>\n<p>The recent probes into Chinese phonemakers follow growing tension between the two nuclear-armed neighboring nations that escalated in 2020 after a skirmish at the border.<\/p>\n<p>India has since introduced several restrictions on Chinese firms. In the past two years, New Delhi has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/13\/india-ban-china-apps\/\">banned hundreds of Chinese apps<\/a>, including TikTok, UC Browser and PUBG Mobile, citing national security concerns. New Delhi also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/18\/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments\/\">amended its foreign direct investment policy in 2020<\/a> to require all neighboring nations with which it shares a boundary to seek approval from New Delhi for their future deals in the country.<\/p>\n<p>While India cuts its reliance on Chinese software and capital, the country still lacks the infrastructure to make a similar go at hardware. New Delhi has launched <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/01\/apples-partners-and-samsung-apply-for-indias-local-smartphone-production-program\/\">lucrative incentives to boost local hardware production<\/a> ecosystem in India in recent years, but analysts say it will likely take several years for such efforts to show meaningful impact.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Four of the top five smartphone vendors in India are Chinese. Indian smartphone makers such as Micromax, Karbonn and Lava lost relevance in the past decade as Chinese smartphone makers and Samsung, which is the second largest handset vendor in India, launched more competitive devices at better prices.<\/p>\n<p>In India, most handsets ship with a price tag below $200. Xiaomi, whose phones punch above their price class, has largely focused to the budget-conscious market from the day it began operations in India. The company has said in the past that it never makes more than 5% profit on any hardware product it sells.<\/p>\n<p>When Xiaomi entered India, it relied mostly on selling handsets online to cut overhead for the first two years. But in the years since, it has established presence in brick-and-mortar markets, which continues to drive much of the sales in the nation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"VPwDQ1gp3I\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/02\/xiaomi-appoints-alvin-tse-as-general-manager-of-india-business\/\">Xiaomi appoints Alvin Tse as general manager of India business<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Xiaomi appoints Alvin Tse as general manager of India business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/02\/xiaomi-appoints-alvin-tse-as-general-manager-of-india-business\/embed\/#?secret=n6MuWJx2vK#?secret=VPwDQ1gp3I\" data-secret=\"VPwDQ1gp3I\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Xiaomi said on Wednesday it has shipped over 200 million smartphones in India to date, demonstrating just how large of a presence it has marked in the world\u2019s second largest phone market in just eight years.

And then in 2019, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/photos\/relive-your-best-memories-new-features-google-photos\/\">started offering photo prints and canvas prints<\/a> in the U.S. Starting today, these two additional printing services are available to Google Photos users in 28 European countries &#8212; basically, the entire European Union plus the U.K. &#8212; and in Canada.<\/p>\n<h2>Google prints<\/h2>\n<p>While there are third-party photo printing services that allow you to upload photos directly from online platforms such as Google, baking a printing service directly into Google Photos removes all the friction &#8212; plus it saves you from giving another company access to your Google account. On top of that, Google Photos has a built-in search function that allows users to find photos by location, time-frame, people and pets, objects, and themes &#8212; this is particularly useful for those looking to print very specific kinds of photos from what is potentially thousands of snaps dating back years.<\/p>\n<p>In Europe, individual photo prints start at \u20ac0.15 each (not including shipping and tax), with the cost creeping up incrementally depending on the size. And in Canada, the price starts at $0.39 CAD. Canvas prints, meanwhile, start at \u00a323.99 in the U.K. for an 8.8-inch print, but it&#8217;s not clear how much they cost in the Eurozone &#8212; a direct conversion from GBP would make it around \u20ac28. Google hasn&#8217;t confirmed how much the service will cost in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that Google introduced a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/20\/google-photos-revives-its-prints-subscription-service-expands-same-day-print-options\/\">photo print subscription service back in 2020<\/a>, which uses AI to automatically print and send out a user&#8217;s best 10 photos of the month.

IT rules including creation of an appeals panel with the veto power to reverse content moderation decisions of social media firms.<\/p>\n<p>Asia Internet Coalition \u2013 which represents Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, Twitter and Spotify \u2013 has urged New Delhi to allow industry to adopt a self-regulatory grievance redressal mechanism as an alternative to grievance appellate committee.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile the proposed amendments state that the intermediary must comply with the orders of the GAC [grievance appellate committee], there is neither any clarity on the extent of the GAC\u2019s powers nor on the limitations in relation to such powers,\u201d they recommended to the government in a letter, which has not been previously reported.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThus, the proposed amendments do not contain adequate restrictions to prevent the GAC from acting as a judicial or quasi-judicial body with wide-ranging authority.\u201d Reuters on Wednesday <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/us-lobby-groups-cast-doubts-over-independence-india-content-appeal-panel-2022-07-20\/\">reported<\/a> that US-India Business Council and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, two lobby groups, have also expressed concerns about the proposed government panel.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">A growing number of countries across the world have introduced &#8212; or proposed to introduce &#8212; new rules in recent years that hold tech giants accountable for actions on their platforms. Advocacy groups have expressed concerns that governments are attempting to assume more control over the content that flows on online platforms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This week, Google and Meta <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-07-19\/google-meta-bow-to-sweeping-taxes-content-curbs-in-indonesia\">agreed to new regulations in Indonesia<\/a>, for instance, that grant the local government sweeping powers to shut down content it deems undesirable.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Asia Internet Coalition urged New Delhi to also hold users accountable for dissemination of certain types of content instead of scrutinizing the platform operators where those content are being communicated or transmitted.<\/p>\n<p>The current rules require intermediaries to acknowledge complaints related to the blocking or removal of users\u2019 accounts within 24 hours and disposed of in 15 days. An amendment to it says that communication links associated with prohibited information must be acted upon within 72 hours of reporting.<\/p>\n<p>The industry body requested the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to retain the pre-existing timeframe with respect to \u201call grievances.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, is a key overseas region for most American tech giants. Google and Facebook identify the South Asian nation as their largest market by users, whereas Amazon and Apple have invested billions in the country over the past decade as they search for their next big growth market.<\/p>\n<p>The increased regulations from New Delhi has escalated tension for\u00a0several tech giants &#8212; and they are fighting back. Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/05\/twitter-sues-india-government\/\">sued the Indian government earlier this month<\/a>, seeking to challenge block orders. WhatsApp <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/whatsapp-sues-india-government\/\">sued the Indian government last year<\/a>, alleging the IT rules could allow local authorities to make people\u2019s private messages \u201ctraceable,\u201d and conduct mass surveillance.<\/p>\n<p>The body has also requested the government to provide clarification on some of the proposed amendments. For instance, the government is seeking to require that intermediaries &#8220;respect&#8221; the rights guaranteed to Indian people by the Indian Constitution.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At present, there is no clarity on what \u2018respecting\u2019 fundamental rights entails. By definition, fundamental rights are available against State or against instrumentality of State. Therefore, the question of an intermediary respecting rights accorded to citizens under the Constitution seems ambiguous. We believe that delegating control of governing and administering fundamental rights to intermediaries, who are private entities, could usher in a culture of self-censorship and become a dangerous inhibitor of free expression,&#8221; Asia Internet Coalition wrote.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Neither does the Constitution of India place any duty on private entities to advance the fundamental rights of users nor are such fundamental rights enforceable against private entities. To the extent it is determined that a private entity is carrying out a \u2018public function\u2019 as per the tests established by the Courts of India, the aggrieved party\u2019s option for redress is subject to the writ jurisdictional powers of the Courts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The body also told the government that a clause in the proposed rules imposes an obligation on intermediaries to compulsorily provide services to users. &#8220;In other words, the intermediaries are being treated like public utilities which needs to be determined whether such an obligation can be imposed by way of rules,&#8221; it added.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An industry group representing several tech giants has requested the Indian government to make a series of changes to the proposed amendments to the country\u2019s new IT rules, warning those amendments \u201cnegate\u201d the government\u2019s commitment to ease of doing business.

After teasing the smart glasses in May, Google says it is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/google-prototype-ar-glasses-testing-public-191041392.html?src=rss\">moving forward<\/a> with &#8220;small-scale,&#8221; &#8220;limited&#8221; public tests, carried out by its employees and &#8220;select trusted testers.&#8221;<\/p>\r\n<p>With cameras, microphones and in-lens displays, the glasses will do things like translate text and help users navigate, but &#8220;they\u2019ll have strict limitations,&#8221; AR product manager Juston Payne said in a statement. Crucially, the &#8220;prototypes don\u2019t support photography and videography, though image data will be used to enable experiences like translating the menu in front of you or showing you directions to a nearby coffee shop,&#8221; Payne added.<\/p>\r\n<p>Google also <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/ar\/answer\/12375092?visit_id=637938659598190004-3795764209&amp;p=prototype-testing&amp;rd=1\">said<\/a> it won&#8217;t conduct tests in places like government offices, hospitals or schools. In other words, if you happen to see its new AR prototypes when you\u2019re out and about, Google wants you to know it is (ostensibly) baking privacy into the product.<\/p>\r\n<p>That&#8217;s a shift from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/06\/27\/sergey-brin-demos-google-glass-at-io\/\">Glass circa 2012<\/a>, which debuted in an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/06\/27\/sergey-brin-demos-google-glass-at-io\/\">over-the-top skydiving stunt<\/a> and was capable of subtly recording users&#8217; surroundings. This time around, it seems like Google would rather avoid a <a href=\"https:\/\/abc7news.com\/google-glass-backlash-resentment-sarah-slocum\/66211\/\">mini-culture war<\/a> over face cameras in the San Francisco Bay Area.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n<p>&#8220;As <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">we continue to explore and learn what\u2019s possible with AR, we look forward to sharing more,&#8221; Payne wrote, offering no specifics on the hardware, pricing or possibility of a wide release.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>AR glasses have not caught on like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/04\/10\/the-glass-collective-is-born\/\">evangelists<\/a> anticipated, but plenty of companies are trying to make them happen anyways. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/29\/niantic-ceo-shares-teaser-image-of-ar-glasses-device\/\">Niantic<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar\/\">Snapchat<\/a> both talked up unreleased pairs of smart glasses last year, and Apple may even have an <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/09\/apple-source-code-references-realityos-for-potential-vr-ar-headsets\/\">AR headset in the works<\/a>.
